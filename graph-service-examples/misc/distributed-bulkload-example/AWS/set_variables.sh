#Recommend to keep the subnetid (and AWS region) same as of Aerospike cluster
#(assuming they're in the AWS as well), to have a hassle free communication between DB and Spark cluster
# When DB is created using Aerolab, it prints its subnetid
SUBNET_ID="<your-subnet>" # This will be changed after creating your Aerolab Cluster

#Aerolab also prints out the security-group associated with the server nodes. The Aerolab log looks like following
